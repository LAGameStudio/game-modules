# game-modules #

A list of game-related modules and examples for writing HTML5 games with
[browserify](http://browserify.org/).

Browserify is a general-purpose build tool for client-side development which
essentially lets you use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)/[npm](http://npmjs.org/)
modules in the browser, but it also fits pretty nicely into HTML5 game
development. The best example project would be [voxel.js](http://voxeljs.com),
which is using browserify and npm extensively to bring Minecraft-like voxel
games to the browser.

The one issue is getting started. That means project setup, getting familiar
with browserify and the Node ecosystem, and most importantly: discovering
modules ([npm](http://npmjs.org/package) has >35,000 packages right now).

In [the wiki](http://github.com/hughsk/game-modules/wiki) you can find a
[**list of modules**](https://github.com/hughsk/game-modules/wiki/Modules)
you can use in your own games, and a
[**list of projects**](https://github.com/hughsk/game-modules/wiki/Projects) built using browserify.

Even if you're using your own toolchain, some of these modules should serve
well as nice and compact reference implementations for your own projects.

If you're interested in browserify or node.js development in general, you
